## About The Project

This project is fulfilling my need for complex aws cli commands that can be used in everyday automation.
The type of automation that one would see and use as a Site Reliability Engineer.  Features will be added
as they are needed by me and my teams.

Why am I not using pkg?  Currently with the state of the project it doesn't make sense to me. Things will be refactored
as the project matures and I feel it is necessary and at a state where moving things from internal to pkg makes 
sense.


## Contributing

I welcome any contributions. Please fork the project on GitHub and open
Pull Requests for any proposed changes.

Please note that I will not merge any changes that encourage insecure
behaviour. If in doubt please open an Issue first to discuss your proposal.

### Developer Workflow

```
In order to properly use this repository you will need to use a standard feature branch workflow.
This can be explained further in the link at the bottom of this section.
